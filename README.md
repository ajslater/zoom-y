# zoom-y

An AppleScript for maximizing the vertical 'zoom' of windows to the display height.

## Install
1. Open this with Apple's Script Editor and export as a script signed to run locally.
1. Bind the script to a hotkey with the app of your choice. I bind to âŒ˜-j with [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/).
